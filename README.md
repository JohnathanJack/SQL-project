# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
My first SQL project in cleaning, transforming and my attempt at analyzing data. 


## Process
1. I first started by checking for errors in the data columns and removed columns I found irrelevant
2. Filled in values that were missing that could be inferred 
3. Checked and removed duplication 
4. Look at the data and tried to see what kind of information I can process and interpret



## Results
This data is able to showcase the relationships between the popularity of a product within countries/cities by grouping the countries/cities and running queries to show which product was mainly purchased. From those results, it was seen that the site mainly dealt with clothing apparel and some electronics. I was also able to determine the overall revenue by infering the data and using it to figure out which country/city has the most impact in their source of income. From those results, it looked like the United States has the most impact in providing them revenue and is believed to be a company that operates for the United States. Online purchases could also be tracked and grouped to determine the primary way customers are reaching the website. This query showed that about 50% of customers are from organic searches. From that information, I looked at the direct searches and wanted to see how much customers are returning and buyying products. In this case, about 75% of direct searching customers are purchasing a product. This indicates to me that when the company website is accessed directly, they are customers who most likely more than one time buyers. 

## Challenges 
1. Cleaning the data for all the tables caused problems as there were a ton of missing values and of duplicated data.
2. Learning what I can cut and what I had to infer to fill in the missing data
3. Joining tables and seeing that there were values that should link but were not (ex: product_skus not in the product table)
4. Determining the primary keys and trying to make them unique to link with other tables through a foreign key
5. Understanding the data and what column represents what type of information

## Future Goals
1. Learn more effective ways to distinguish between duplicated data so I could be more confident in the analysis portion. 
2. Learn more ways to perform QA on my queries to ensure they are accurate.
