# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
My first SQL project 

<!-- Adding pictures  -->
<!-- ![description](location_of_image) -->

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
1. Cleaning the data for all the tables caused problems as there were a ton of missing values and of duplicated data.
2. Learning what I can cut and what I had to infer to fill in the missing data
3. Joining tables and seeing that there were values that should link but were not (ex: product_skus not in the product table)
4. Determining the primary keys and trying to make them unique to link with other tables through a foreign key
5. Understanding the data and what column represents what type of information

## Future Goals
1. Learn more effective ways to distinguish between duplicated data so I could be more confident in the analysis portion.
